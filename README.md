# We luv' Arte

Go on http://maxwellito.github.io/weluvarte and follow the instructions.

This repo is a basic script injection to get video files links on arte.tv (+7 replay). The principle is simple: using a bookmark to inject `injector.js` on the current tab to find the video file links and display them at the top of the page.

Now compatible with Chromecast ([Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd) required).
